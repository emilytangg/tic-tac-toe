# Tic-tac-toe
This project is a simple tic-tac-toe game which serves as a personal learning activity to understand the basics of React.js. I thought it would be nice to jump straight into a basic project to see how things work in React, rather than learning the fundamentals and trying to build something from scratch (I have been struggling with this). The main thing I want to achieve by working on this project is to gain more confidence in coding with React and JavaScript so then I can go onto making a project of my own using these new skills :)

## Ideas for Improvement
### Suggestions from [Tutorial: Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#completing-the-game):
- [ ] Display the location for each move in the format (col, row) in the move history list.
- [ ] Bold the currently selected item in the move list.
- [x] Rewrite Board to use two loops to make the squares instead of hardcoding them.
- [ ] Add a toggle button that lets you sort the moves in either ascending or descending order.
- [ ] When someone wins, highlight the three squares that caused the win.
- [x] When no one wins, display a message about the result being a draw.

### My own ideas
- [ ] Add a title screen where players can enter their names
