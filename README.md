# Tic-tac-toe
This project is a simple tic-tac-toe game which serves as a personal learning activity to understand the basics of React.js. I thought it would be nice to jump straight into a basic project to see how things work in React, rather than learning the fundamentals and trying to build something from scratch (I have been struggling with this). The main thing I want to achieve by working on this project is to gain more confidence in coding with React and JavaScript so then I can go onto making a project of my own using these new skills :)

## Acknowledgements
* [Tutorial: Intro to React](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#completing-the-game): The project is based off this tutorial, however I am working on modifying the tutorial code and adding my own features :)
